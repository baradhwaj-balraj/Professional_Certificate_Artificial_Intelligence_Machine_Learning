#  Practical Application Assignment 17: Comparing Classifiers
## In this practical application, the objective is to explore a marketing dataset from a portugese banking institution. Additionally,in this practical application need to compare and contrast the performance of various classification models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and Decision Trees) to determine which performs best when predicting client churn.
### In the second link there is a folder containing a Jupyter notebook in which the performance of various classification models were evaluated to determine which model would be best for predicting churn. If you want access to look over the notebook in GitHub just open through the folder in this second link.

### The Findings Were:
##### 1.) Decision Tree model performed best when it comes to predicting churn and is the model I would reccomend utilizing for this business problem.
##### 2.) K-Nearest Neighbors is a close second and I would suggest using it if training time is a concern. The reason for this is it performs slightly worse than the decision tree model but has the fastest training time. 
##### 3.) Logistic Regression model is good at distinguishing between churn and non-churn but it is important to note that this model will miss many potential churners and as a result I would not suggest using it for this business problem.
##### 4.) SVM model performed the worst at predicting churn. As a result I would avoid using this model for this business problem.
### Some Future Steps Are:
##### 1.) Analyze the specific features to discover which features are most important when predicting churn and explore those features further.  


#  Practical Application Assignment 11.1: What Drives The Price of A Car?
## In this exercise the goal was to take a dataset found on Kaggle regarding used car features and price to determine which factors have an impact on car price.  Upon completion should be able to inform used car dealerships what features consumers value in a car.
### In the second link there is a folder containing a Jupyter notebook in which data analysis was performed to determine which features of used cars impact their prices the most. Use Jupyter Notebook link to access the notebook through Jupyter. If you want access to look over the notebook in GitHub just open through the folder in this second link.
