#  Practical Application Assignment 11.1: What Drives The Price of A Car?
## In this exercise the goal was to take a dataset found on Kaggle regarding used car features and price to determine which factors have an impact on car price.  Upon completion should be able to inform Used Car Dealerships what features consumers value in a car.
### In the attached folder there is a Jupyter notebook in which data analysis was performed to determine which features of Used Cars impact the price of used cars the most. Use Jupyter Notebook link to access the notebook through Jupyter. If you want access to look over Notebook in GitHub just open through the folder in this second link.

### The Findings Were:
##### The 4 features that most impacted the price of used cars in order were: 
##### 1.) Year of the car model  
##### 2.) Fuel Type (Gas, Diesel, Hybrid)
##### 3.) How many cylinders are in the engine
##### 4.) How many miles on the odometer
### Some Future Steps Are:
##### 1.) Analyze which year cars are selling for highest price. 
##### 2.) Analyze which Fuel Type is selling for highest price. 
##### 3.) Analyze which cylinder engine is selling for highest price. 
##### 4.) Analyze what range of miles results in highest price. 

#  Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will The Customer Accept The Coupon?
## This exercise is a deep dive into a dataset that from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver.
### In the attached folder there is a Jupyter notebook in which data analysis was performed to determine will the driver accept the coupon based on a variety of different variables.

###  Some of The Findings Were: 
##### - From data can infer that people who went to the bar 3 or less times were more likely to accept coupons.
##### - From data can infer that people who went to bar more than once a month and are older than 25 tend to accept coupons more that any other group who also went to bar.
##### - From data it is evident that about 88% of people that went for Carry Out accepted coupons.
##### - From data can infer that people who go for Carry Out while being in a relationship tend to accept coupon more than people who are not in relationships.
##### - From data can infer that people who are in a relationship and have a kid tend to accept coupon more than people who are in a relationship and dont have kids.
##### - From data can infer that people who are in a relationship have kids and get Carry Out 4 or more times a month have a higher chance of accepting coupons than same group of people that go less than 4 times a month.
### Some Future Steps Are:
##### - Find out data about drivers that go to different locations where coupons are accepted and analyze coupon data for those locations.
##### - Analyze data regarding people who refuse coupons and see if there is anything in common with the people who refuse coupons.
##### - Analyze if income has any impact on coupons being accepted or rejected.


##### 5.) Suggest Used Car Dealerships clean up inventory based around these features to have used car inventory that is most desirable for customers to increase sale of dealership.
